          <p>When Alexandr Wang co-founded Scale AI in 2016 at age 19, his company’s name was something of a joke. After all, with only three employees, Scale had yet to scale up.</p>
          <p>Now, the company has around 300 employees and is worth $3.5 billion, making Wang the CEO of one of the biggest AI companies in Silicon Valley. After dropping out of MIT and joining Y Combinator’s spring 2016 batch, Wang didn’t know what kind of startup he was going to create. He then had a breakthrough moment: companies wanted to integrate machine learning, but most didn’t have the tools or resources that Big Tech did for their in-house AI projects. That’s when Wang hit upon the idea for Scale, which makes AI infrastructure for developers to build from. </p>
          <p>The company grew to unicorn status within three years, and has raised nearly $300 million to date. Clients include companies from a range of industries: OpenAI, Lyft, Nuro, Airbnb, Samsung, and Pinterest, among many more. According to Wang, every industry could be using AI in just a few years’ time.</p>

          <h1>“One of the really cool things about AI is that data is the new code.”</h1>
          <p>MIT was a very engineering oriented school. Mechanical engineering majors are building catapults on the lawn, and electrical engineering majors are building robots. And computer science majors are building apps for their friends to use. But there was nobody building anything with AI, despite the fact that there were hundreds of students at MIT, all brilliant, very hardworking people. We're all studying AI. And when I dug into it, I realized that the data was the big bottleneck for a lot of these people to build meaningful AI. It took a lot of time and resources to add intelligence to data, to make it usable for machine learning. There were no standardized tools or infrastructure, there was no AWS, or Stripe, or Twilio to solve this problem. </p>
          <p>I even discovered it firsthand, because I wanted to build a camera inside my fridge, so it could tell me when to refill my groceries and what I need to buy. Even for that I just didn't have any of the data to make it work. We saw at that point, there was this really big hole or problem that needed to be solved for AI to actually reach its full potential. That was the inspiration behind starting the company. Since then, obviously AI has only become more important and more impressive. A more top of mind technology, self driving cars have been this huge industry that has popped up, along with more recent advancements from OpenAI with GPT-3, and protein folding AI. It just continued to explode in this massive way, which has been really incredible to see.</p>
